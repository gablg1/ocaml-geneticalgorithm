# Where is the install location?  OMake installs files into the
# following directories.
#    BINDIR: program executables
#    LIBDIR: omake standard library

# What C compiler do you want to use?
# By default, the C compiler is "cc", unless "gcc" is found on your system.

# Do you want native and/or byte code?
# By default, we make native code.  If you want

# Do you want to include readline for the interactive shell?
# Your system appears to support readline, so this is enabled by default.

# Do you want to include terminal information (terminfo) capabilities?
# Your system appears to support ncurses, so this is enabled by default.

#
# Do you want to include filesystem monitoring? This will enable the
# omake -P and -p options, which are quite useful.

#
# The OCAMLDEP_MODULES_ENABLED variable specifies whether to use the -modules
# option to ocamldep.  Dependency analysis is much better with this option,
# but it is also a little slower.  Also, the -modules option is only
# available with the standard OCaml distribution starting with the 3.10 release.
# OMake includes a patched ocamldep, in case you want to use it with an older release
# of OCaml.
