*** curry branch

- What happens to exports from curried functions?

  curry.f() =
     export
     public.X = 1
     fun() =>
        println($X)

- The arity of a ValPrim is used for partial application,
  but the arities are often wrong.

- It is assumed that a primitive function, when partially
  applied, takes -all- the keyword arguments.  Nearly
  all the primitives will choke if passed a keyword.
